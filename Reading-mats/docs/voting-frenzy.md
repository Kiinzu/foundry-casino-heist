In the heart of the casino lies the ultimate test of influence, ENUMA and ALPHA are going head-to-head to see which one of them actually has the most influence there. In order for one of them to win, they must reach a certain point in the vote. Well, by data, we know that ALPHA reigns above everything in the casino, but by "system", we know that ENUMA can win. Why? I don't know—you might know how—but sure, once that happens, everything will be in **FRENZY**. &nbsp;

## Logic Errors

Logic error in smart contracts refers to a flaw or unintended behavior in the design or implementation of the contract's logic, unlike bugs like overflow or reentrancy attacks, logic errors occur when the contract **doesn't perform the expected task correctly**, even though the code is syntactically correct. This can lead to unexpected outcomes, like financial loss or security vulnerabilities. Some of the examples may include, but are not limited to: &nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

1. **Voting System Logic Flaw** &nbsp;  
    A voting contract may incorrectly count votes, change the voters status, incorrectly assign votes to the candidates, etc. &nbsp;  
    &nbsp;  
2. **Incorrect Access Control** &nbsp;  
    A contract might incorrectly assign permissions, enabling unauthorized actions. &nbsp;  
    &nbsp;  
3. **Flawed Token Distribution Logic** &nbsp;  
    A logic error in a token contract may result in extra tokens being minted or distributed incorrectly or funds being locked unintentionally. &nbsp;  
    &nbsp;  
4. **Inconsistent Condition Checks** &nbsp;  
    A conditional statement might contain errors, such as checking *if (x > 0)* when it should be *if (x >= 0 )*, which could lead to unexpected rejection or allow unintended operations. &nbsp;  
    &nbsp;  

There are many other examples of this, but we want to highlight the most common logic flaw that exists out there.
